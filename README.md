## How it Works


## APIs Used




## Database

## WireFrame

- HTML - this is the markup language for our document to be displayed on the web browser
- CSS - this is the language we use to style an HTML document as well as describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
- JavaScript - this  is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else
- React - this allows developers to build reusable UI components that can be easily composed to create complex user interfaces. It follows a declarative approach where developers describe how the UI should look and behave in response to changes in state, rather than imperatively defining how to manipulate the DOM.
- MongoDB - this is an open-source, NoSQL, document-oriented database management system. It is designed to store and manage data in a flexible and scalable manner.
